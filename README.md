I have made a project "Census of India", that leverages the power of Power BI and SQL to provide comprehensive insights into India's economic landscape. This interactive and user-friendly dashboard presents data from the Census of India, enabling users to explore, analyze, and gain a deeper understanding of the country's population dynamics.

Demographic Insights: The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of India's population, including data on Literacy rate, Region wise population.

Geospatial Analysis: Utilizing Power Bi's Geo Map capabilities, the dashboard includes interactive maps that allow users to visualize population density and Growth patterns across different regions of India. 

Historical Trends: I have Used DAX calculation and prepare Past census data and also compare with Current census data to track changes in population characteristics over time.
